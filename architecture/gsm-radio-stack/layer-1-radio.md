## GSM Layer 1 - Radio

GSM Layer 1, also known as the Physical Layer, handles the radio transmission and reception.&#x20;

It deals with modulation, demodulation, frequency hopping, and time-division multiple access (TDMA).&#x20;

This layer ensures the correct transmission of data between the mobile station and the network.

In GSM, the Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) technique is used to allocate specific time slots to multiple users on the same frequency channel.&#x20;

Each user transmits in rapid succession, one after the other, each using their allocated time slot.

This method enables multiple mobile stations to share the same frequency channel without interference, maximizing the efficiency of available bandwidth.
