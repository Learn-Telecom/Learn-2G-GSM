#### System Information-2 (SI2)

**System Information-2 (SI2)** is a critical broadcast message used in cellular networks. It contains essential configuration details, such as:

* Access parameters for the Random Access Channel (RACH)
* Information on the broadcast control channel (BCCH)
* Timing Advance (TA) details

This information helps devices establish and maintain communication with the network efficiently.
