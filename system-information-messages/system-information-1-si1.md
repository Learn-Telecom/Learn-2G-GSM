# âœ… System information-1(SI1)

System Information 1 (SI1) is a message broadcast by GSM base stations to provide critical information to mobile stations (MS). It includes the location area code (LAC), cell identity (CI), and information about neighboring cells.&#x20;

This data allows the MS to determine whether it can access the network and helps in the cell selection and reselection processes.
