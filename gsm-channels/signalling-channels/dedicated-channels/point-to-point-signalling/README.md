#### Point-To-Point Signalling

Point-to-point signaling refers to a communication method where a direct and dedicated communication path is established between two endpoints.&#x20;

This type of signaling is often used in telecommunications and networking to facilitate reliable data transmission between specific nodes or devices without interference from others.&#x20;

Each connection in point-to-point signaling is unique, providing a secure and direct line for data exchange.
