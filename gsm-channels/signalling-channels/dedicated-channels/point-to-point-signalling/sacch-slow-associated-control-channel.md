# âœ… SACCH - Slow Associated Control Channel

### Slow Associated Control Channel (SACCH)

The Slow Associated Control Channel (SACCH) is a dedicated channel used in mobile communications for the transmission of control and signaling information between the mobile station (MS) and the base station subsystem (BSS).&#x20;

It operates alongside voice or data channels to provide essential control functions. SACCH supports tasks such as:

* **Measurement Reports:** The SACCH is responsible for transmitting measurement reports from the mobile station. These reports include information about the signal quality and strength of neighboring cells, which aids the network in making decisions about handovers and optimizing the connection quality.
* **Power Control:** SACCH facilitates power control mechanisms by enabling the network to instruct the mobile station on the required power levels for transmission. This helps in maintaining optimal signal strength and reducing interference, thereby improving overall network efficiency.
* **Timing Advance:** Additionally, SACCH manages timing advance adjustments, which are necessary to synchronize the timing of transmissions from the mobile station to the base station. This ensures that signals from different mobile stations do not interfere with each other, particularly in TDMA-based systems.

By effectively handling these control activities, SACCH plays a crucial role in maintaining the quality and reliability of wireless communications.
