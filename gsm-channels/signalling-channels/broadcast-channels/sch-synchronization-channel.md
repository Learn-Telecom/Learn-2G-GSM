# âœ… SCH - Synchronization Channel

Is used to synchronize the BTS and Mobile Station in timeslot Zero.

Send data about TDMA Frame number that contains the Base Station Identity Code (BSIC) and compares with the information on SIM card to validate network operator if it fails it try again the FCCH channel.

#### SCH - Synchronization Channel

The Synchronization Channel (SCH) is a crucial component in the GSM network architecture. It is used to synchronize the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) with the mobile station during communication.

Specifically, the SCH transmits time correction data and the TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) frame number along with the Base Station Identity Code (BSIC).&#x20;

This information is essential for the mobile station to validate the network operator, ensuring a secure and accurate connection.&#x20;

The SCH operates in timeslot zero within the TDMA frame, playing a vital role in maintaining proper timing and network synchronization.
