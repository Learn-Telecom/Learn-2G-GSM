# âœ… CBCH - Cell Broadcast Channel

The CBCH, downlink only, is used to carry the short message service cell broadcast (SMSCB). The CBCH uses the same physical channel as the SDCCH.

The Cell Broadcast Channel (CBCH) is a type of downlink channel used specifically for transmitting cell broadcast messages.&#x20;

It provides a mechanism for delivering short message service cell broadcast (SMSCB) messages to multiple users simultaneously within a specific geographic area.&#x20;

This channel operates using the same physical resources as the Stand-alone Dedicated Control Channel (SDCCH), optimizing the use of available frequency spectrums without disrupting other communication services.&#x20;

CBCH facilitates efficient real-time information dissemination, such as weather alerts or public announcements, to a broad audience.
