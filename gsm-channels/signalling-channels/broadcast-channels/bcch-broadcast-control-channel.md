It negotiates the cipher to be used and other information about telco services.

#### Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH)

The Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH) is a crucial component in mobile communication systems. It operates within the GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) framework and is responsible for broadcasting essential system information from a base transceiver station (BTS) to mobile stations (MS) within its cell.&#x20;

The BCCH carries data about the network's identity, available services, and operating frequencies, thus enabling mobile devices to initiate communication with the network effectively.

Key functions of the BCCH include:

* **Network Identification:** Provides the Mobile Station with the identity of the network it is connected to.
* **Frequency Information:** Broadcasts the frequencies and hopping sequences utilized by the network.
* **Service Information:** Details various services and capabilities available within the cell, such as SMS and call handling features.
* **Neighbouring Cells Information:** Lists the neighbouring cells, aiding in efficient handover decisions as a mobile station moves between different cell coverage areas.

The Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH) in GSM networks is essential for transmitting system information from a base transceiver station to mobile stations.&#x20;

It facilitates key functions such as providing network identification, broadcasting frequency and service information and listing neighboring cells to support effective communication and handover processes.
