# Intro

GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) is a standard developed to describe protocols for second-generation (2G) digital cellular networks used by mobile phones.

It became the default global standard for mobile communications, ensuring interoperability of mobile devices across different regions.&#x20;

GSM technology operates in various frequency bands, primarily 900/1800 MHz, and utilizes time division multiple access (TDMA) to divide each frequency channel into time slots.&#x20;

This allows multiple users to share the same bandwidth efficiently. GSM supports voice calls, SMS, and limited data services, forming the backbone of modern mobile communication systems.
