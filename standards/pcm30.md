# PCM30

#### GSM PCM30

GSM PCM30 is a telecommunications standard used to transmit multiple voice signals over a single medium. It employs the Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) technique to digitally encode analog voice signals. In PCM30, 30 voice channels are multiplexed into one transmission frame, with each channel allocated its own time slot.&#x20;

Additionally, 2 time slots are used for signaling and synchronization, resulting in a total of 32 time slots per frame.&#x20;

This setup allows efficient and high-quality voice communication in digital networks.
