Location Area Identification (LAI) is a unique code used in mobile networks to identify a specific location area within a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN). It consists of:

* **Mobile Country Code (MCC)**: Identifies the country.
* **Mobile Network Code (MNC)**: Identifies the network within the country.
* **Location Area Code (LAC)**: Identifies the specific location area within the network.

LAI is crucial for managing the location and registration of mobile subscribers when they move between different areas, ensuring seamless connectivity and effective resource allocation.
