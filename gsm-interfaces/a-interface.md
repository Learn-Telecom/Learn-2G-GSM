# âœ… A interface

A interface connects a MSC and BSC Transcoder.

As data from User and Signaling

64 kbps per time slot

128 channels

Adaptation from ISDN-S2M interface, the interface can handle up to 8192 kbps of data.&#x20;

This interface is crucial for ensuring efficient communication and data transfer between the MSC and BSC Transcoder, maintaining the integrity of both user data and signaling information.&#x20;

The adaptation from the ISDN-S2M interface ensures compatibility and streamlined operations within the cellular network infrastructure.

#### Understanding the ISDN-S2M Interface in Cellular Networks

The ISDN-S2M interface is essential for seamless integration within cellular networks, connecting the Mobile Switching Center (MSC) and the Base Station Controller (BSC) Transcoder.&#x20;

* **Data Handling:** The interface supports high-speed data transfer at rates up to 8192 kbps.
* **Channel Capacity:** It utilizes 128 channels, with each time slot capable of transmitting at 64 kbps.
* **Purpose:** This ensures that both user data and signaling information are transmitted effectively, maintaining data integrity across the network infrastructure.
